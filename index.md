      Did a carnivorous Homo erectus cause Pleistocene mammal extinctions in
      Africa?
    content: >
      To find out, our team is studying the ecomorphology and stable carbon
      isotopes of fossil carnivores, and applying cutting edge paleo food web
      modeling. 


      The ancient hominin impacts hypothesis states that the large-brained and
      technologically sophisticated *Homo erectus* caused profound impacts on
      Pleistocene mammal communities, driving both large herbivore species and
      competing carnivore species to extinction. However, at the time Homo
      erectus first appeared, eastern Africa was experiencing climate-driven
      grassland expansions, which may also have contributed to extinctions in
      carnivores and herbivores. It is currently unknown whether environmental
      change, human impacts, or a combination of both best explains the observed
      Pleistocene mammal extinctions. 


      We are testing the hypothesis of ancient hominin impacts  using a paleo
      food webs approach in the Koobi Fora Formation in Kenya, the site where*
      Homo erectus* first appears in the eastern African fossil record. First,
      we are conducting anatomical and isotopic studies of the Koobi Fora
      carnivores (e.g., saber tooth cats and hyaena relatives) to determine
      which herbivore species each extinct carnivore would have eaten and to
      reveal which carnivores *Homo erectus* likely competed with. 


      Next, we will construct food webs and use an established modeling
      framework to conduct numerical experiments in order to predict the likely
      extinction impacts resulting from the introduction of a generalist
      predator (i.e., *Homo erectus*), climate-driven grassland expansion alone,
      and grassland expansion in conjunction with competition from *Homo
      erectus*. We will compare the output of these modeling experiments to the
      observed record of mammal extinctions as a strong test of the ancient
      human impacts hypothesis.
